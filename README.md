# DepartmentSchedule
This R program accepts a csv file that has course listings (Course, Section, Days, Times, Faculty member)
for a department. It then produces a graph of the schedule, which can be saved as a PDF file.
When I run the program, I nudge things a bit here and there using Illustrator to improve readability. 
Courses that are scheduled for the same time slot are "jittered" in the schedule, so sometimes they overlap a lot.
